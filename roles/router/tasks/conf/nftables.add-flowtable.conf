# - this file adds a flowtable for HW/SW Offload of forwarded connections
# after all VLAN interfaces have been created (i.e. by systemd-networkd)
# - needs to be started by a separate systemd service

# don't flush the ruleset .. we just add this to the tables created already by the main


table inet filter {
    # used for SW/HW offloading established / related connections, see main forward chain
    flowtable fwdtable {
        hook ingress priority 0;
        # TBD also add wireguard and docker interfaces here
        devices = { wan, enp1s0f0np0, enp1s0f1np1, enp2s0, enp3s0, guest, ghetto }
    }

    chain forward_flowtable_offload {
        # make sure this has lower priority than the main forward chain in the filter table
