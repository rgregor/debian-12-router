# We only need a link-local address for IPv6 (required to run IPv6),
# but not for IPv4 (using DHCP).
LinkLocalAddressing=ipv6
# SLAAC IPv6 for obtaining the default route.
# This is needed, because the DHCPv6 response does not include an
# address with a gateway for the prefixes. We're supposed to use
# the SLAAC-announced default route one as the 'return route'.
IPv6AcceptRA=yes
# Boolean true enables both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client. See also the
# IPv6AcceptRA.DHCPv6Client setting.
DHCP=yes
#automaticall√∂y enables ipv4 and ipv6 forwarding between ALL interfaces on the system!
# restrictions need to be introduced by firewall

# The following settings might also be useful when your ISP does not want to delegate a Prefix, see manpage for detzails
